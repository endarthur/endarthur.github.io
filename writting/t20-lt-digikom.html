        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Digikom is a browser based geological compass most probably useful as a teaching aid. It was built
            using <a href="https://github.com/dorukeker/gyronorm.js/issues/61">gyronorm</a>, <a href="https://peerjs.com/">peerjs</a>
            and a partial js port of <a href="https://github.com/endarthur/autti">auttitude</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I started learning a bit of javascript when I started this github personal page, as a way to add some
            <a href="/index.html">interactivity</a>.
        </p>

            <input type="number" min="0" max="360" value="120" oninput="movePoint(this, 0)"/>
            <input type="number" min="0" max="90" value="30" oninput="movePoint(this, 1)"/>

        </figure>

        <script>
            var at = Auttitude;
            var plt = new auttiplot.EqualArea("stereo1", true);
            var point_attitude = [120, 30];
            var a = at.dcosPlane(point_attitude);
            var point_marker = plt.as_point(a);
            var gc_line = plt.as_line(a.great_circle());
            var movePoint = function(slider, index){
                point_attitude[index] = slider.value;
                var p = at.dcosPlane(point_attitude);
                plt.svg.removeChild(point_marker);
                plt.svg.removeChild(gc_line);
                point_marker = plt.as_point(p);
                gc_line = plt.as_line(p.great_circle());
            }
        </script>
        <p>
            I did a partial port to javascript of <a href="https://github.com/endarthur/autti">auttitude</a>,
            which is a structural geology data analysis and plotting library I have been working on since
            undergrad that is currently being used as the engine for
            <a href="https://openstereo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">openstereo</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a side note, having some way to easily work with structural data in javascript allows for some
            fun, as in creating an alexa skill for voice activated "stereonets" and adding a custom plot for
            <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/">google data studio</a>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img
              src="../img/data_studio_stereo.png"
              alt="Tocher dataset plotted on google data studio"
            />
            <figcaption>
              Figure 2 - mostly "because why not?".
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            As different phone OSs at the time presented orientation data differently, I used 
            <a href="https://github.com/dorukeker/gyronorm.js/issues/61">gyronorm</a> as a way to normalize
            the input.
        </p>
        <p>
            While at first I only plotted the stereonet in response to changes in phone orientation,
            I eventually got the idea of trying to connect it to a desktop computer somehow.
        </p>
        <h2>Enter WebRTC</h2>
        <p>
            I originally wanted to offer a connection from the cellphone directly to
            openstereo, but my first attempt
            (making the phone POST the data to a server running on the desktop computer) ended up being
            sluggish and unreliable on some networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I eventually found out about the WebRTC api, which allows for direct peer to peer communication between users.
            Giving up at first on integrating this to openstereo (I couldn't find any library nor understand how at the time
            to do WebRTC in python/PyQT5), I decided to use the browser as the visualization platform as well. This is the
            <a href="https://digikom.surge.sh/">current page of Digikom</a>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img
              src="../img/chrome_GEVkvGUoBB.png"
              alt="Digikom main page on a desktop"
            />
            <figcaption>
              Figure 3 - Digikom already connected to a phone.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            One of the complicated issues in using WebRTC is signalling, that is, exchanging information between the two
            browsers on how to connect. At the time, as I wanted to build only a simple static page, I used
            <a href="https://peerjs.com/">peerjs</a>, which is a nice and really simple to use library for this kind
            of communication in the browser, supporting everything that WebRTC has, such as data, audio and video
            streams (which, combined with some other really cool modern browser APIs, allows you to easily do stuff as
            <a href="../tools/screen.html">sharing your desktop</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            They offer their own free signalling server, so you really only have import the library and it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it works. As a free of charge service offered to the community, it can be hard to connect and get a peer id
            sometimes. As an alternative, you could use a simpler library, as <a href="https://github.com/feross/simple-peer">simple-peer</a>
            and build your own signalling server. That consists of exchanging the signal data between the peers and
            then all subsequent communication is directly between the users.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will eventually add a link here to a version doing this running on <a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a>.

        <h2>Javascript can be really fun!</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, I have to say that my adventures in learning javascript have been really interesting. Browsers
            have some really cool APIs nowadays, and with some libraries as presented above, or maybe ones that use
            WebGL, such as <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> or on another layer of abstraction, webVR as
            <a href="https://aframe.io/">a-frame</a>, you can quickly prototype and build <a href="./aframe_path.html">fun projects</a>!
        </p>

            <p>1. Always check if the angle between two consecutive survey points is not zero or near zero; if so, use the tangent method
                for the segment instead of spherical arc, as the numerical precision might blow up and give you bad results.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the subject of angles, you can either use the arccosine of the dot product or the arctangent of the magnitude of
                the cross product over the dot product. The second method is much more precise for small angles and will allow you to
                use a closer tolerance before considering that the angle between two survey points is zero. It's costlier in terms
                of processing, though.
