        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Desurvey is the practice of obtaining the geometry of a drillhole through
            its deviation survey data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here we present two methods: <a href="#tangent-method">tangent</a> and <a href="#spherical-arc">spherical
                arc</a>.

        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        Considering a right-handed coordinate system, with \(x\) pointing east, \(y\) north and \(z\) up,
        <ul>
            <li>
                \(x_i\) &mdash; the spatial location vector of each survey point, being \(x_0\) given as the collar of
                the drillhole.
            </li>
            <li>
                \(v_i\) &mdash; the plunge vector of the drillhole at the survey points. It is usually calculated from
                the measured
                trend \(\theta\) and plunge \(\phi\), with positive plunge downwards:
                $$
                v_i = \begin{bmatrix}
                \sin(\theta)\cos(\phi)\\
                \cos(\theta)\cos(\phi)\\
                -\sin(\phi)\\
                \end{bmatrix}
                $$
            </li>
            <li>
                \(a_i\) &mdash; the position along the drillhole on where each survey was made.
            </li>
            <li>
                \(s_i\) &mdash; the length of the segment between each \(i\) and \(i+1\) survey points, that is,
                $$s_i = a_{i+1} - a_i$$
            </li>
        </ul>
        <a name="tangent-method"></a>
        <h2><a href="#tangent-method">Tangent</a></h2>
        <p>
            The simplest method is to consider the drillhole a sequence of straight segments
            with the same down-hole orientation as the last survey point. For that, we simply accumulate \(s_i v_i\)
            from \(x_0\) to
            obtain each \(x_{i+1}\) in sequence:
            $$
            x_{i+1} = x_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{i} s_j v_j
            $$
        </p>
        <p>
            To obtain the coordinates of an arbitrary point \(p\) at position \(d\) along the drillhole find \(i\) such
            that
            \(a_{i+1} > d\), then
            $$
            p = x_i + (d - a_i) v_i \label{tangent}\tag{1}
            $$
        </p>
        <a name="spherical-arc"></a>
        <h2><a href="#spherical-arc">Spherical arc</a></h2>
        <p>
            The spherical arc method, also known as minimum curvature, treats each segment of the drillhole as a great
            circle arc with
            length \(s_i\) that encompass the angle<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> \(\alpha_i\) between each
            survey point \(i\) and its successor
            \(i+1\). Being \(\alpha\)
            in radians, the radius \(r_i\) of the sphere can be calculated as
            $$
            r_i = {s_i \over \alpha_i}
            $$
        </p>
        <p>
            To obtain the center \(c_i\) of the sphere, we must offset \(x_i\) a distance \(r_i\) perpendicular to
            \(v_i\) on the plane
            spanning \(v_i\) and \(v_{i+1}\). The normal \(n_i\) to this plane is obtained through
            $$
            n_i = {{v_i \times v_{i+1}} \over {|v_i \times v_{i+1}|}}
            $$
        </p>
        <p>
            from this, the vector \(q_i\) perpendicular to \(v_i\) is simply
            $$ q_i = n_i \times v_i $$
        </p>
        <p>
            being the center then
            $$
            c_i = x_i + r n_i \times v_i.
            $$
        </p>
        <p>
            Using \(v_i\) and \(q_i\) as an orthogonal pair spanning the plane, the position of the next survey point
            \(x_{i+1}\) is built as
            $$
            x_{i+1} = c_i - r q_i cos (\alpha_i) + r v_i sin (\alpha_i) \label{sphere_survey}\tag{2}
            $$
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, an arbitrary point \(p\) at position \(d\) along the drillhole is found using \(i\) such that
            \(a_{i+1} > d\). Its angular position \(\theta\) along the great circle is
            $$ \theta = {{d - a_i} \over r_i} $$
        </p>
        <p>
            This angle can be plugged into equation \(\ref{sphere_survey}\) instead of \(\alpha\) so that we get
                $$
                    p = c_i - r q_i cos (\theta) + r v_i sin (\theta) \label{sphere}\tag{3}
                $$
        </p>
        <hr>
        <sup id="fn1">
            <p>1. Always check if the angle between two consecutive survey points is not zero or near zero; if so, use the tangent method
                for the segment instead of spherical arc, as the numerical precision might blow up and give you bad results.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the subject of angles, you can either use the arccosine of the dot product or the arctangent of the magnitude of
                the cross product over the dot product. The second method is much more precise for small angles and will allow you to
                use a closer tolerance before considering that the angle between two survey points is zero. It's costlier in terms
                of processing, though.
