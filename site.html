        <h2>"Design"</h2>
        <p>
            So, my strongest influences currently are <a href="https://www.gwern.net/">Gwern</a> and
            <a href="https://www.alicemaz.com/">Alice Maz</a>, using the footnotes idea from
            <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2005/07/footnotes">daring fireball</a> <sup>(<a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190628221915/https://daringfireball.net/2005/07/footnotes">ia</a>)</sup>
            through <a href="https://karlwinegardner.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-create-footnotes-in-html.html">Karl
                Winegardner</a><sup>(<a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web20190628222122/http://karlwinegardner.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-create-footnotes-in-html.html">ia</a>)</sup><sup><a
                    href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considering Gwern's own <a href="https://www.gwern.net/About">"about this site"</a> writtings on
            page archiving, I've also added <a href="https://archive.org/web/">internet archive</a> links for the links
            referenced, and if inline marked with <sup>(ia)</sup>. I am also using the idea of adding a "created" and
            "modified" timestamps on top of the page, to help me remember when I started.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most html is handwritten, as are the svg figures. I'll also add some interactivity through javascript, as in
            the index.html page. That was born the day I realised that I should probably have a business card, and got
            thinking about what could I do to make it somewhat useful. So my web geological compass was born. A crazier
            version is hosted on <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge</a>, <a href="https://digikom.surge.sh/">Digikom</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Write-up on that someday?
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm using mathjax to render math in general using LaTeX notation. There is a really small subset of my
            directional data analysis library reimplemented in javascript, <a href="js/autti.js">autti.js</a>. For
            now it doesn't really provide that much functionality, mostly implement a simple directional vector class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next idea for that is using it for a small page on directional data handling, with some interactive
            "calculators".
        </p>
        <p>
            On that note, <a href="https://www.movable-type.co.uk/">Movable Type Ltd</a> <sup>(<a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190710040111/https://www.movable-type.co.uk/">ia</a>)</sup> is a
            strong inspiration on
            trying to build useful javascript pages. They have really nice explanations and scripts for working with
            geographical data.
        </p>
        <h2>Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            This website is a static github page. I'm not tracking anything, and don't intend on ever doing that. Using
            github issues as a comment system seems a reasonable method to allow feedback, though you can just email me
            at gmail, as endarthur. Or tweet.
